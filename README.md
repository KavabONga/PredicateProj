Generator of logical expressions with the ability to translate them to a given *language*. 
This algorithm can be used to **generate methematical expressions**.\
*Pretty cool, right?*

1st place at **HSE CS project contest** among lyceum students.

It's a generator of logical expressions with the ability to translate them to a given *language*. 

### Examples

All the output is translated to LaTeX:

|     |     |     |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|*Basic*|*Mathematical*|*English*|
|![Basic](img/BasicScreenshot.png)|![Math](img/MathScreenshot.png)|![EngNatural](img/EngNaturalScreenshot.png)|
<br>
Adjacent expressions are similar because the algorithm outputs the lines in lexigraphic order

Here are actually interesting generated "statements" (not all of them are true)

**1)** 2 is a prime number\
**2)** <del>Every number is prime</del>\
**3)** Prime numbers exist **!**\
**5)** Every number is equal to itself\
**6)** There are numbers which are equal to themselves\
**7)** Not all numbers are prime\
**8)** <del>Prime numbers don't exist</del>\

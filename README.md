Once upon a time I was going through Twitter and saw the [#tweetcart](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tweetcart) posts from a lot of different devs, so I wanted to join in and make some cool carts myself.

A ***Tweetcart*** is a piece of code that fits in a tweet (280 characters) and results in an animation/game.\
Some of my carts are minimized, some aren't. In the end it was just Lua practice.

I didn't have [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and didn't want to pay, so I used [TIC80](https://tic.computer/), a free, simplified alternative "fantasy computer".
